# Cadmus Refs VIAF Lookup

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.0.

This is preliminary work. This should wrap VIAF for quick lookup. TODO: add VIAF options component, and use query to allow users pick a subject and/or an index.

Note that VIAF requires JSONP, and thus also `HttpClientJsonpModule`.
