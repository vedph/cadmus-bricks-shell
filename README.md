This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.4.

ðŸ‘€ [Bricks Demo](https://cadmus-bricks.fusi-soft.com)

This project is a shell for incubating a number of Cadmus sub-models, implemented as Angular components with their editing UI.

As Cadmus projects increase, the prototype code needs to be chopped into smaller portions, so that they can be easily reused with minimal overhead. Yet, we need a smooth migration because most Cadmus projects are in a production stage, nor I have time to refactor everything at once.

The upgrade strategy is thus starting with the creation of "bricks", i.e. the sub-model components shared by many projects. Each of these bricks should be wrapped in its own module. So, in the end we will have a library project for each brick.

At this stage, the bricks themselves depend on more monolithic Cadmus libraries, like the Cadmus core. In future these will be split; but at this time, we just depend on them, so that nothing gets broken in the dependencies chain, and new projects can leverage the new bricks while still using the traditional dependencies.

Quick Docker image build (the only purpose of this image is letting testers play with controls in the incubator):

1. `npm run build-lib`.
2. ensure to update the version in `app.component.html`, and `ng build --configuration production`.
3. `docker build . -t vedph2020/cadmus-bricks-app:0.1.3 -t vedph2020/cadmus-bricks-app:latest` (replace with the current version).

## Adding a Brick

To add a brick:

1. add a library project to this workspace: `ng g library @myrmidon/LIBNS-LIBNAME --prefix cadmus-LIBNS`.
2. add a control in the library.
3. add a corresponding host page in the app, with its menu and route.

## History

- 2022-11-25: replaced `CadmusValidators` with `NgToolsValidators` in `@myrmidon/cadmus-refs-proper-name`.
- 2022-11-23: added `@myrmidon/cadmus-ui-note-set` (from `@myrmidon/cadmus-codicology-ui`).

### 1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 onwards target the new Cadmus shell, which starts from Angular 15.

- 2022-11-22: migrated to Angular 15, adjusting for new Material.
- 2022-11-21: fix to _required_ flag in lookup.

### 0.1.3

- 2022-11-11: added more properties/events to annotator.

### 0.1.2

- 2022-11-02:
  - updated Angular and packages.
  - added image annotator brick (using [recogito Annotorious](https://recogito.github.io/annotorious/) with a thin Angular wrapper).
- 2022-09-15: updated Angular.
- 2022-08-04:
  - honor H before W in physical size pipe and label.
  - updated Angular.

### 0.1.1

- 2022-08-03: added `@myrmidon/cadmus-refs-asserted-ids` library and moved the old `@myrmidon/cadmus-refs-asserted-id` into it. Thus, now library `@myrmidon/cadmus-refs-asserted-id` is deprecated, and should be replaced by `@myrmidon/cadmus-refs-asserted-ids`, which includes the same component plus another one for editing multiple IDs at once. Also, this should also deprecate `@myrmidon/cadmus-refs-external-ids`, which refers to a legacy model where the external ID had a rank, and then got an assertion later. It is recommended to prefer the new `AssertedId` based model and consider `ExternalId` as deprecated. In bricks backend, these are the models:

```txt
ExternalId
 - Tag
 - Value
 - Scope

AssertedId : ExternalId
  - Assertion

RankedExternalId (deprecated) : ExternalId
  - Rank

Assertion
  - Tag
  - Rank
  - References
  - Note

DocReference
  - Type
  - Tag
  - Citation
  - Note
